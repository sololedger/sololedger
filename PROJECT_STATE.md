# SoloLedger Project State

Last updated: 2026-10-04

## Current Baseline

- Repository: `C:\Users\Familjedator\Desktop\Sololedger Multi User App\sololedger_multi_user`
- Branch: `main`
- Remote: `https://github.com/sololedger/sololedger.git`
- Local `main` / `origin/main`: `8740c4d`
  (`KAN-38 enforce VAT V2 payment roles`).
- Production path: GitHub `sololedger/sololedger` `main` -> Vercel team
  `sololedger1`, project `sololedger`, domain `https://sololedger.vercel.app`.
- Push to `main` auto-deploys Vercel Production. Treat any future push to
  `main` as a production deploy requiring explicit approval for that risk.
- This checkout has no `.vercel/project.json`; do not use manual Vercel CLI
  deployment without re-verifying team/project context and explicit approval.

## Durable Truth

- `AGENTS.md` is the permanent rulebook.
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` is the current handoff/checkpoint.
- `PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md` holds compact completed history/evidence.
- `Architecture.md` is the current technical map.
- Jira is the work queue/status/backlog, not source of truth for code or DB.
- Chat history is not sufficient project truth for a new session.

## External Connections

- Jira cloud ID: `42c6216d-73c5-4777-a644-c41ef9bc6a1a`
- Jira project: `KAN` / `Sololedger`, project ID `10001`
- Supabase production project ref: `wbaxmuvudpnkvuliicuy`
- Live Supabase migration head documented/verified after KAN-38:
  `20261004152057`.
- Established Supabase CLI entry point: `npx --yes supabase@latest`.
- `supabase/.temp/` may exist as generated Supabase CLI state only. Do not
  read/display secrets and do not add this directory to Git.

## Jira Status Snapshot

Verified from Jira on 2026-10-04:

- Done: KAN-3, KAN-13, KAN-21, KAN-29, KAN-30, KAN-31, KAN-32, KAN-33,
  KAN-37, KAN-38.
- To Do: KAN-9, KAN-10, KAN-11, KAN-14, KAN-22, KAN-23, KAN-24, KAN-25,
  KAN-34, KAN-35, KAN-36, KAN-39.
- KAN-29-KAN-33 are External Audit #1 completion work and are Done.
- KAN-37 is completed/pushed/deployed/IRL-verified by Pontus.
- KAN-36 is future inventory/depreciation product work.
- KAN-38 is completed, live-migrated, Production-deployed, and IRL-accepted by
  Pontus on a separate test account.
- KAN-39 is the follow-up UX finding from KAN-38 acceptance: clearer
  bookkeeping form inputs and non-duplicated VAT V2 missing-role validation.

## Product Acceptance Direction

- Primary acceptance path remains a real small Swedish enskild firma without
  employees. When facts are missing, SoloLedger asks, blocks, or explains; it
  must not guess.
- Parked real Adobe EU-service scenario remains blocked from live data changes
  until the Skatteverket/Adobe outcome is known.

## Current Active Work

- No implementation is active.
- KAN-39 is available as a small UX follow-up. Do not implement it until Pontus
  selects/approves it as the next work item.

## Known Non-Blockers / Debt

- Full repo lint still has older unrelated debt.
- KAN-24 and KAN-25 remain To Do for scoped `page.tsx` technical debt.
- KAN-39 covers KAN-38 acceptance UX findings: weak affordance/contrast for
  Date/Description fields and duplicated missing-payment-role validation text.
- KAN-36 remains future inventory/depreciation product work.
- KAN-34 remains future UX for completing VAT facts on ambiguous legacy/SIE
  rows.
- KAN-35 remains low-priority UI transaction-history completeness follow-up.
- FAQ copy around `Skattekonto (2012)` is identified as potentially confusing:
  it should eventually distinguish private tax/F-tax via 2012 from controlled
  VAT/tax-account lifecycle flows.
- General legacy default-upgrade policy is a future architecture/product topic,
  not implemented.

## Git / Local Files

- Working tree should be clean except for any explicitly approved docs-only
  finalization checkpoint after KAN-38 closeout.
- KAN-38 code checkpoint `8740c4d` is pushed to `main` and deployed to
  Production.
- The canonical External Audit #1 files `SOLOLEDGER_AUDIT_*.md` are tracked as
  an immutable historical snapshot.
- `KAN-32-IRL-legacy-reverse-charge.se` was externally archived and is no
  longer present in the repo worktree.
- `supabase/.temp/` remains generated local Supabase CLI state and is ignored.

## Local Test Environment

- Production-derived local PostgreSQL DB `sololedger_kan17c_test` remains the
  preferred safe DB/RPC regression environment when live data writes are not
  approved.
- PostgreSQL 17 client may exist at
  `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin\psql.exe`.
- Authorized local credential file for isolated local PostgreSQL verification:
  `C:\SoloLedger\LocalTest\pgpass.conf`.
- Never read/display/copy/hash pgpass contents; use it only through
  process/session-local `PGPASSFILE`.

## Next Safe Step

1. Commit the docs-only KAN-38 finalization checkpoint locally if not already
   done; do not push it without separate approval because `main` deploys
   Production.
2. Pontus/leader chat chooses the next work item, likely KAN-39 if the new UX
   finding should be handled next.
